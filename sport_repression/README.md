## Sport Repression: Impact of Hosting Major Sporting Events

### Overview:
This project investigates the relationship between hosting major sporting events and political repression in different regions. The project is divided into five separate Jupyter Notebooks, with each notebook addressing a specific research question related to sport repression and its effects.

### Research Questions and Notebooks:
1. **Q1: Overview**
   - This notebook provides an overview of the project, including the research objectives, data sources, and theoretical background on sport repression and its potential impact on regions hosting major sporting events.

2. **Q2: Repression in Departments with and without Host Cities**
   - In this notebook, we explore the level of political repression in departments that hosted major sporting events compared to those that did not. We analyze the differences in repression levels to assess the potential impact of hosting such events.

3. **Q3: Graphical Overview of Effects**
   - This notebook presents a graphical overview of the effects of hosting major sporting events on political repression. We use visualizations to highlight the patterns and variations in repression levels across different regions.

4. **Q4: Robustness Check Using a Dichotomous Indicator of Repression**
   - In this notebook, we perform a robustness check using a dichotomous indicator of repression. We examine the effects of hosting sporting events on repression, taking into account various factors that could influence the results.

5. **Q5: Robustness Check Using Matched Samples**
   - This notebook conducts a robustness check using matched samples. We match departments that hosted sporting events with similar departments that did not, enabling a more controlled analysis of the impact on political repression.

### Data Source:
The data used in these notebooks is sourced from [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/RJY34I
]. The dataset includes information on political repression indicators, and relevant factors for different regions in Argentina.

### Papers and Theoretical Background:
The notebooks are based on research papers that provide the theoretical background and context for studying sport repression and its effects on political conditions.

### Instructions to Replicate Results:
1. Install the required packages from the `requirements2.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements2.txt
   ```

2. Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook 1 to Notebook 5) to view the code, data analysis, and visualizations for each research question.
