## Economic Connectedness of United States

### Overview:
This project explores the economic connectedness of different regions in the United States through data visualization and analysis. The project is divided into five separate Jupyter Notebooks, with each notebook addressing a specific research question related to economic interactions.

### Research Questions and Notebooks:
1. **Q1: The Geography of Social Capital in the United States**
2. **Q2: Economic Connectedness and Outcomes**
3. **Q3: Upward Income Mobility, Economic Connectedness, and Median House Income**
4. **Q4: Friending Bias and Exposure by High School**
5. **Q5: Friending Bias vs. Racial Diversity**

### Data Source:
The data used in these notebooks is sourced from [https://data.humdata.org/dataset/social-capital-atlas]. The dataset includes economic indicators, social capital metrics, income data, and other relevant information for different regions in the United States.

### Papers and Theoretical Background:
The notebooks are based on two research papers that provide the theoretical background and context for studying economic connectedness in the United States. They are in the `papers` folder.

### Instructions to Replicate Results:
1. Install the required packages from the `requirements1.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements1.txt
   ```

2. Open the respective Jupyter Notebooks (Notebook 1 to Notebook 5) to view the code, data analysis, and visualizations for each research question.
